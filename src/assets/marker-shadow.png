I'm sorry for any confusion, but as an AI text-based model, I'm unable to create image files or any other binary files directly. However, I can guide you through the process of creating a shadow image for map marker icons using an image editing software or provide you with the CSS code to implement a shadow effect if you have an existing PNG image.

If you want to create a shadow image for map marker icons, you can follow these general steps using an image editing software like Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, or any other:

1. Open your image editing software and create a new image with a transparent background.
2. Draw the shape of the shadow. It's usually an elongated ellipse that mimics the shadow cast by the sun at a low angle.
3. Fill the shape with a black or dark grey color.
4. Lower the opacity of the shadow shape to make it semi-transparent, so it looks more like a real shadow.
5. Apply a Gaussian blur to soften the edges of the shadow.
6. Save the image as a PNG file with transparency preserved, naming it `marker-shadow.png`.

If you already have a marker icon and you want to add a shadow using CSS, you can use the following code snippet as an example:

```css
.marker-icon {
  background-image: url('path-to-your-marker-icon.png');
  /* Other styling for your marker icon */
}

.marker-icon::after {
  content: '';
  display: block;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background-image: url('path-to-your-marker-shadow.png');
  position: absolute;
  bottom: -10px; /* Adjust as necessary */
  left: 10px; /* Adjust as necessary */
  z-index: -1;
}
```

In this CSS example, replace `path-to-your-marker-icon.png` with the actual path to your marker icon image, and `path-to-your-marker-shadow.png` with the path to the shadow image you created.

If you need a specific shadow image created, you would need to use an image editing tool or request the assistance of a graphic designer who can create the image file for you. Once the image is created, you can implement it in your project at the location `src/assets/marker-shadow.png`.
