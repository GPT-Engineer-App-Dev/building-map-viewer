I'm sorry for any confusion, but as an AI developed by OpenAI, I'm unable to create or manipulate image files directly through this text-based interface. However, I can guide you on how to create a standard pin icon for map markers using image editing software or provide you with the code to generate an icon if you're using a web-based application.

If you're looking to create a `marker-icon.png` file, you would typically use a graphic design software like Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, or an online tool like Canva or Figma. Here's a general guide on how to create a pin icon:

1. Open your chosen image editing software.
2. Create a new file with a transparent background. The size can be 32x32, 64x64, or any other size depending on your needs.
3. Draw the pin shape. A standard map pin icon is often shaped like an upside-down teardrop or a balloon.
4. Choose a color for your pin. Red is a common choice as it stands out, but you can choose any color that fits your design.
5. Add any additional details or effects, such as a border, shadow, or gloss, to make the icon stand out or to match your design aesthetic.
6. Save the file as a PNG with transparency to maintain the quality and to make sure it can be overlaid on any map without a background.

If you're working with web technologies and want to generate a pin icon using code, you could use SVG or CSS to create a simple pin icon. Here's an example of how you might do it with HTML and inline SVG:

```html
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
  <path fill="#D32F2F" d="M12 2C8.13 2 5 5.13 5 9c0 5.25 7 13 7 13s7-7.75 7-13c0-3.87-3.13-7-7-7zm0 9.5c-1.38 0-2.5-1.12-2.5-2.5S10.62 6.5 12 6.5s2.5 1.12 2.5 2.5S13.38 11.5 12 11.5z"/>
</svg>
```

This SVG code creates a simple red map pin icon. You can adjust the `width`, `height`, and `fill` attributes to customize the size and color of the pin.

If you need to create an actual PNG file, please use the appropriate software or online tool to do so, and then you can save the file as `src/assets/marker-icon.png` in your project directory.
